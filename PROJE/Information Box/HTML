                <h3>Glass Waste</h3>
                <p>Some countries have developed special methods for recycling glass waste. For example, in Sweden, glass waste is melted to generate heat energy, which is used to heat cities or generate electricity. This method not only ensures the disposal of glass waste but also contributes to the production of renewable energy.</p>

                <p>The organic wastes obtained are converted into methane gas (biogas) by bacteria through anaerobic fermentation process, turning it into an energy source containing 50% to 75% methane. While this method prevents organic waste from harming the environment, it contributes to the reduction of fossil fuel use and the prevention of approximately 20 million tons of CO2 emissions by producing approximately 2 billion cubic meters of biogas per year.</p>

                <p>Nestle in search of planet-friendly packaging
                    One of the famous companies committed to this quest for sustainability is Nestle. The maker of Nespresso, San Pellegrino and Kit-Kat is the world's largest food and beverage company. This 150-year-old company employs more than a quarter of a million people, has hundreds of factories and sells its products in 186 different countries. So how can Nestle ensure that its business on such a large scale doesn't harm the planet? 
                    
                    
                    Jodie Roussell, Nestle's Global Head of Packaging and Sustainability, says progress is already being made:
                    
                    "Our vision is to ensure that none of our packaging ends up as litter in landfills. We are working to reduce our use of virgin plastic and are on track to reduce it by a third by 2025. There are some very good examples in the European Union today, with harmonization work starting on labeling and bins, as well as common targets being set. This kind of legislation gives us hope that we can facilitate consumer engagement and business compliance. And it allows us to focus on what matters most, getting the right outcome and ensuring that no packaging ends up as litter or in landfills."
                    Another company at the forefront of making circularity a core business strategy is French car giant Renault. 

                    The automobile industry not only dumps huge amounts of waste into landfills every year, but also toxic chemicals and metals. But Renault wants to change this trend. 

                    Every year, 11 million cars in Europe reach the end of their life. And 85 percent of the materials used in car production are recyclable. The Renault Group presents the Refactory as Europe's first circular economy site designed for cars.

                <p>The European Union has proposed new rules to reduce paper and plastic packaging waste. The proposed new rules are part of the EU's Circular Economy package, which aims to reduce pressure on natural resources and create more sustainable growth.

                    EU Commission Senior Vice-President Frans Timmermans and Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius held a press conference in Brussels on the "Circular Economy Package".
                    
                    Reminding that the EU Commission had previously limited various single-use plastic products such as straws, forks, knives, cups, plates and food containers, Timmermans said, "Today we are taking a step to make the entire packaging sector circular."
                    Timmermans said that the way products are packaged could be improved, noting that many products already come in very large boxes and cargo orders are sent in larger packages than necessary.

                    Reminding that in some cafes, meals are served in disposable containers instead of normal plates, Timmermans said that consumers leave behind "mountains of garbage" for this reason, "Excessive packaging is a very important problem that is increasingly damaging our environment."
                    Emphasizing that their proposal aims to reduce the use of packaging and will reduce over-packaging, Timmermans said that they want more packaging to be reusable and that reusable packaging is also positive for the environment.

                    Timmermans said, "All packaging should be easy to recycle. Packaging should be made from recycled materials as much as possible. Businesses will have to offer some products in reusable packaging."</p>

                <p>We travel to Malaysia in the footsteps of young people around the world who are breaking barriers and making change. We are with Sydney Steenland, an environmental changemaker with an inspiring and amazing story. 

                    The 16-year-old has lived on a sailboat with her family since childhood. Her story of moving to a boat was initially motivated by her family's financial difficulties. But then it turned into a way of life. And thanks to this unique lifestyle, Sydney has been able to see places around the world that most children can only dream of. 
                    
                    "As we traveled, we encountered amazing places and beautiful nature, but also horrible things like plastic," she says. "It didn't matter where we went, what country we were in, the economic situation of the region, there was plastic in every environment."
                    According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, at least 14 million tons of plastic waste enter the world's oceans every year. Plastic waste accounts for 80 percent of all garbage in the seas. 

                    Sydney and her family, who closely witnessed the huge dimensions of plastic pollution in the oceans, started a social enterprise project. The Sea Monkey Project, named after their sailboat, thus said 'hello' to life. In this context, they recycle the plastic waste they collect and produce souvenirs.
                    The project, which was launched when Sydney was only 11 years old, has so far recycled more than 22,500 plastics. 

                    Stating that they have organized nearly 10 thousand training workshops, the young environmentalist thinks that it is necessary to take a small step, no matter in which field, and adds:
                    
                    
                    "You may care about different things in the world such as poverty, hunger, climate change, plastic pollution and so on. But when you want to start doing something, you need to start doing it physically. It can be anything, it doesn't matter how small it is."</p>

                <p>Long-distance train travel is set to return to its popular days in many countries. Whether it's the anxiety caused by the travel chaos at airports in recent months, the effort to avoid the high carbon emissions of airline transportation, or the change in perception that the journey is as important as the destination in the search for a quieter life after the Covid-19 pandemic... Whatever the reason, train travel is once again becoming a favorite mode of transportation for travelers.

                    In May 2021, the legendary covered-coat train service between Paris and Nice in France resumed after a four-year hiatus. On July 1, the Paris-Hendaye service began operating only during the summer months. Running until August 28, it will carry passengers from the heart of France to the Spanish border at the Bay of Biscay.
                    
                    In Austria, state railways OeBB has launched a series of international routes. With these new services, you can fall asleep in Vienna and wake up in Amsterdam, Brussels or Rome.
                    
                    
                    In the UK, Calendonian coaster trains have been reintroduced between London and Scotland. 
                    
                    Sweden's extensive and successful intercity sleeper service has also become world-famous thanks to climate activist Greta.
                    In order to increase the capacity of sleeper services in France, the national rail company SNCF has converted 100 trains destined for the scrapyard into new sleeper trains. The Charentes Périgord technical center near the historic Perigeaux station in the south of the country has already completed half of the recycling target.

                    "The biggest challenge is to finish the work in time to start service as planned at the end of 2021," says Mathieu Michaud, director of the center in Perigeaux.
                    
                    
                    Many of the wagons have already been dismantled for parts to maintain the fleet. Many are damaged, dented and beyond repair, says Julien Polito, stock manager. "These are damaged wagons that are not suitable for commercial use in the fleet, so we are working very hard to bring them up to a certain standard before putting them back into service," he explains.
                    
                    The exterior of the trains, the electrics, the toilets, the toilets, the internet, the lighting, the beds, the seats, in short, every single corner is overhauled.
                    
                    Polito says that it takes 2500-3000 hours of work to convert a car into a sitting car and about 4,000 hours of work to convert it into a couchette car.</p>

                <p>Dubai has taken its commitment to a sustainable future one step further with the launch of the Dubai Can project. While the project aims to reduce the city's use of plastic bottles in the long term, in the first phase, it encourages residents and tourists to use reusable water bottles with 40 new water filling stations across the city. 

                    Yousef Lutah, Vice President of Dubai Sustainable Tourism, said: "Creating infrastructure, giving people solutions, enabling them to substitute plastic bottles and making them understand the impact of their action has created a movement and it has snowballed since we started in February. We've looked at a lot of initiatives and in the next phase, we're focusing on banning plastic bags. We are looking at a complete ban on plastic bags within two years."
                    
                    More than 500 companies from the public and private sectors have already partnered with the Dubai-based campaign, with many sponsoring their own water fountain. They include international hotel groups, which are making major changes internally.
                    
                    Recent data shows that 4 billion plastic bottles are used in the United Arab Emirates in a year, and 40 percent of all plastic in the country is single-use. This has devastating consequences for life.  That's why participatory efforts like Dubai Can will have a significant impact going forward. 
                    
                    The Dubai Can initiative even uses the latest water technologies to produce drinking water from the air.
                    Another initiative making a difference towards a greener Dubai is Recap, a free, recyclable waste collection app. Together with a local partner, the Veolia group turns plastic bottles into padding and fabric fiber for pillows. The app also uses a reward system

                    Jérôme Viricel, Managing Director of Veolia, said: "In the United Arab Emirates, we saw that communities are very keen to recycle more with any initiative. That's why we decided to launch Recap, promoting the company's core value of ecological transformation in the UAE. The idea is to offer a simple and efficient service to collect recycling materials on the doorstep of everyone living in the UAE."
                    
                    Movements like the Dubai Can initiative, with its slogans "a small change, a big impact" and "recharging with life", are just a small example of what can be done for a more sustainable, plastic-free future.</p>

                <p>"If concrete were a country, it would be the third largest contributor to carbon dioxide pollution in the world after China and the United States."

                    These are the words of Dr. Michael Wise. Wise is the head of technology at a company called Concrete4Change. This company has just developed a different kind of concrete that absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
                    
                    Michael Wise and his team's top priority is to change the structure of concrete, the most basic product of the construction industry that we all use in the construction of homes and workplaces, and turn it into an environmentally friendly material. Because 8 percent of the world's CO2 emissions are released during concrete production.
                    
                    
                    So is it possible to develop a concrete that absorbs greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?
                    
                    Dr. Michael Wise answers this question as follows:
                    
                    "Our technology will help recycle the CO2 emissions released by the construction industry, reduce costs in the sector and extend the lifespan of buildings."
                    
                    Wise says that the new generation of concrete they have developed increases the durability of buildings and permanently mineralizes (petrifies) the injected carbon dioxide. In addition, the new technology uses fewer resources to produce concrete of equivalent strength to older concrete.
                    Dr. Michael Wise says that this technology has the potential to reduce two billion tons of CO2 released by the construction industry, equivalent to an average of four percent of global emissions. This is equivalent to about 50 percent of the emissions caused by the current construction industry.

                    Stating that the product they developed can be used in all kinds of construction areas such as houses, workplaces, skyscrapers and factories, Wise said, "The only difference of this concrete is that it is cheaper and durable."</p>
